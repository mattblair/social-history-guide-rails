<h1>About The PDX Social History Guide</h1>
<p>PDX Social History Guide is a free app and website featuring stories about people and places vital to the city of Portland's cultural heritage. Portland has been home to many ethnic groups and cultures &mdash; including Native American, African American, Chinese, Japanese, Greeks and Jews, among others. Because of urban development, some of these communities have little physical remnants of their neighborhoods. Consequently, many visiting Portland for the first time &mdash; and even those that have lived here many years &mdash; are unaware of the city's history. PDX Social History Guide brings these stories to the surface through interviews, mapping and smart phone technology, as well as a corresponding website.</p>
