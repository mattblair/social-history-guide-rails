# Social History Guide 

The PDX Social History Guide is a website featuring location-based stories reflecting the multicultural history of downtown Portland, OR, USA. The site brings these stories to the surface through interviews, mapping, art and photos. Each story features a summary, audio clip, and an image or map.

To see the project in action:
* [Website](http://pdxsocialhistoryguide.org "PDX Social History Guide")
* [On the App Store](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/pdx-social-history-guide/id737566738?ls=1&mt=8 "PDX Social History App")

My goal is for this platform (the app and the site) to be reusable in whole, or at least in parts, in other communities and locations who want to gather and share their stories. 

To achieve this, a lot of the Portland-specific elements need to be factored out into environmental variables, the database, etc. Admittedly, I took a few shortcuts just so we could get this project launched without over-optimizing for imagined contingencies. Generalizing the codebases will be a non-trivial amount of work, but I've made decisions along the way with that in mind. Suggestions are welcome.
